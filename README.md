# Sprint Kanban

Sprint Kanban is a productivity web application designed to help users organize their work, focus on what matters, and achieve more using energy-matched tasks and kanban boards. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and TypeScript, Sprint Kanban brings together task management, focus sprints, and visual dashboards to maximize your productivity.

## Features

- **Kanban Task Management:**  
  Organize your tasks into customizable kanban columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) and track your progress visually.

- **Focus Sprints:**  
  Use energy-based focus sprints to match tasks to your current energy level and boost productivity.

- **TaskCat Companion:**  
  A cute, draggable companion that shows your remaining tasks and keeps you motivated.

- **Visual Progress Dashboards:**  
  Track overall progress, daily stats, and task completion milestones.

- **Task Editing & Management:**  
  Add, edit, categorize, and delete tasks. Assign energy level, category, estimated time, and kanban column.

- **Achievements & Motivation:**  
  Unlock achievements and enjoy playful UI elements like floating bubbles and animated feedback.
